Adapt MP - A Mobile App that is Gameified Training for amputee patients, to train muscle memory, to better use the Prostethic Limb given
to them. Using the MyoBand as Input, which reads the muscle movements, they can get use to the different flexes needed to control this limb.
These are two of the minigames I worked on, for this effort. I was laid off before this project was finished.

Canon Expo- 
Every 5 years Canon has a world wide expo showing off new tech. They have an Augmented Reality Headset used in manufacturing and other
commercial uses. I was tasked with creating a scenario using this HMD(Head Mounted Device). The scenario I was told to create was that of 
an oil rig maintenance. Using a Logitech Steering Wheel to simulate a valve, on a pipeline, and a throttle to simulate a power break switch.

This is some code from that Scenario, which was well recieved by Canon. I can give direcet References from managers at Canon, of my profesionalism and quality of work done, this was an off site job, so I worked 
out of the office at a workshop directly with members from the Canon Team.

Code Test - This was a programming test that had 3 parts.
  String Sorting
  Unique Digit Detection
  Maze Room Builder and Solver.

Code Test 2 - Programming test with a Binary Tree
  Binary Tree Parser , and somne other small things

Test - Another Programming Test
  Create and maintain and non contigous memory buffer.
